# Challenge 3

*Clean up your resources after use!*

## Scenario:

This one is a bit different, the terraform creates the resources, but lets pretend your colleague has created an ec2 and is attempting to mount a volume from a previous ec2 onto it. He keeps getting a red banner with an error message and is unsure what to do.

In order you troubleshoot, please attempt to mount the ec2 volume to the ec2 machine via console.

Solution is in its own file for this one as the text would be too close and give away too quickly.
